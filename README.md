The files in this repository are only a partial representation of the actual project.
The original work at Defence Research and Development Organisation (DRDO), India was much larger, highly data-oriented, and involved confidential ML model development.
Due to the sensitive nature of the research, the complete datasets, code, and detailed findings cannot be shared here.

‚öôÔ∏è Actuation Systems & Hydraulic Actuator Project with Life Prediction ML Model
üìå Project Overview

This repository contains my academic project work on actuation systems and hydraulic actuators, with a focus on their applications in aerospace vehicles and missiles.

The project explores:

Principles of hydraulic, pneumatic, and electric actuation systems

Detailed study of hydraulic actuators, bootstrap reservoirs, accumulators, servo valves, and pump-motor packages

Applications in Thrust Vector Control (TVC) and Aerodynamic Control (ADC) for missiles and aerospace systems

Simulation and analysis of actuator behavior under different operating conditions

üõ†Ô∏è Actuation System Study

Hydraulic Actuation System

Uses pressurized fluid for high-force applications

Components: reservoir, servo valve, accumulator, non-return valve, pump-motor, filters, actuators

Applications: thrust vectoring of missile engines, fin actuation in aerodynamic control

Pneumatic Actuation System

Uses compressed air for control and guidance

Applications: light-weight control surfaces where high force is not critical

Electric Actuation System

Motor-driven actuators for clean, precise applications

Limitations in torque-speed characteristics compared to hydraulics

Hydraulic Actuator

Works on Pascal‚Äôs Law and Bernoulli‚Äôs principle

Converts fluid power into mechanical motion

Simulated with ANSYS FEA for stress & fatigue and ANSYS CFD for fluid dynamics

üî¨ Machine Learning Integration

In addition to studying actuation systems, I developed a machine learning model for life prediction of actuators and related components.
